## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Depression Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to assess potential depression indicators.
*   **Mobile Application:** Designed as a mobile app for accessibility and user convenience.
*   **Midterm Project:** Developed as a submission for a Mobile Application Programming midterm exam.
*   **Kotlin Based:** Implemented using Kotlin, a modern and concise language for Android development.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Android Studio:** The official IDE for Android app development. Download the latest version from [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio).
*   **Kotlin:** Ensure that Kotlin is properly configured within Android Studio.
*   **Android SDK:** Install the necessary Android SDK versions required by the project. Configure through Android Studio's SDK Manager.
*   **Gradle:** The project uses Gradle as its build system. Android Studio typically handles Gradle setup automatically.
*   **Emulator/Physical Device:** An Android emulator or a physical Android device is required to run the application.
*   **Machine Learning Libraries:** (Specify here, e.g., TensorFlow Lite) - If the project uses specific ML libraries, mention them and their versions.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rascalosh/map-midterm-exam.git
    cd map-midterm-exam
    ```

2.  **Open the Project in Android Studio:**

    *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned `map-midterm-exam` directory.

3.  **Sync Gradle:**

    *   Android Studio will prompt you to sync the Gradle project. Click "Sync Now".

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *   If the project uses any specific libraries or dependencies, they will be downloaded and installed automatically by Gradle. If any errors occur, check your internet connection and Gradle configuration.

5.  **Configure Emulator/Connect Device:**

    *   Start an Android emulator (using Android Virtual Device Manager) or connect your physical Android device to your computer. Ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device.

6.  **Run the Application:**

    *   Click the "Run" button (green play icon) in Android Studio.
    *   Select your connected device or emulator.
    *   The application will be built and installed on the selected device/emulator.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Due to the nature of this project being a midterm exam submission, detailed API documentation might not be available. Refer to the code comments for specific functionalities and usage details.

*   **Running the App:** Once installed, the app's main screen will allow users to interact with the depression detection feature.
*   **Input Methods:** The app might require user input through text fields, questionnaires, or sensor data (if applicable).
*   **Output Interpretation:** The app will provide an output based on the machine learning model's analysis. Interpret the results carefully and seek professional help if needed.

## Configuration Options

This section describes any configurable settings or parameters within the application.

*   **ML Model Configuration:** If possible, provide details on how the machine learning model can be configured or updated. This might involve specifying model file paths or adjusting prediction thresholds.
*   **API Keys (if applicable):** If the app uses any external APIs, provide instructions on setting up API keys.
*   **User Interface Settings:** Any user-customizable settings within the app (e.g., theme, font size) should be explained here.
